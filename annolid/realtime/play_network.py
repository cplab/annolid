    :class:`RemoteData` over the network.
    The typical process is:
    #. Start playing a camera in Filers.
    #. Set up the recorder to the network server,
       #. Provide a IP address it'll serve the images, e.g. "localhost" if it's only served on the local computer.
       #. Provide a port, a number above 5000 to serve the images on.
       #. Start the server.
       #. Start recording images to the network. If there are no clients connected, no images are actually sent. You can
          also start recording after a client has connected and requested to play.
    #. On the client side,
       #. Create a `TestRemoteVideoPlayer` with the given IP and port.
       #. Call `start_listener` to connect to the server so we can communicate with it. You must now constantly call
          `process_in_main_thread` to handle incoming messages from the server.
       #. When you're ready to handle images, call `play`. If the server is already recording it'll immediately start
          sending messages. Otherwise, it'll start sending messages when you click record in Filers. Either way it'll
          first send a `process_recording_state` message so you know to expect images.
    #. On the client side you can hit `stop` and the server will stop sending images. Or on the server side you can
       stop recording and then the server will send a `process_recording_state` to let you know to stop expecting
       images until the next time you start recording in Filers.
       You can circle back to the last step to start again.
    #. Client calls `stop` and then `stop_listener` to disconnect from the server.
    If there are any exceptions from the server or the internal thread, `process_exception` is called (via
    `process_in_main_thread`). Similarly, `process_recording_state` is called (also via `process_in_main_thread`)
    when the server changes it's recording state. `process_image` is called (also via `process_in_main_thread`) for
    each image we get from the server.
