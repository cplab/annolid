    """
    Transcribes audio from either a WAV file path or raw WAV data (bytes)
    using the moonshine_onnx library.

    For raw bytes input, it saves the audio to a WAV file in a structured directory
    before transcription for better organization and potential letter checking.

    Args:
        audio_input: Either:
                       - a string representing the path to a WAV file,
                       - raw WAV data as bytes (e.g., from audio_input.get_wav_data()).
        model_name (str, optional): The name of the moonshine model to use for transcription.
                                     Defaults to 'moonshine/base'.
        output_dir (str, optional): The directory where WAV files from raw bytes will be saved.
                                     Defaults to "audio_files".

    Returns:
        list[str]: A list containing the transcribed text as strings, as returned by moonshine_onnx.
                   Returns None if there is an error during processing.
